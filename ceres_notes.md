1. questions
   Problem class // what is this??

- how to add multiple cost functions/functors?
- [ ] what is AutoDiffCostFunction
- [ ] what is the step size of the gradient descent optimization?
- [ ] what is residual here, what differences between cost function?
- AutoDiffCostFunction
- NumericDiffCostFunction
- nonlinear least square

## notes:

modules:

    - CostFuntor (cost function)
  - state variables, x (need initial values)
  - add residual block
- CostFunction
  - Evaluate
    - residual
    - jacobians
- Solver
  - problem
  - summary, options

## TODO

- [ ] Read and understand the tutorial of Ceres Solver.
- [ ] Read and understand example 10. slam pose graph 2d 
- [ ] "slam/pose_graph_2d/pose_graph_2d.cc"
