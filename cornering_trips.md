# notes:
- sideslip seems not obvious (< 1 deg) when small cornering (< 30 deg)
- sideslip seems obvious (0 to 10 deg) when significant cornering (> 90 deg)
- heading availability can be viewed by status code: ins status and position type.
- track ground is not robust
- 10+ deg sideslip could be normal

# ideas:

- Take a look at more observations?
	- [ ] How about using fusion velocity to compute ground speed?
	- [ ] must take velocity and attitude into account
