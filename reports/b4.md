# Notes
The bag 2018-10-13-13-44-38 has two stationary periods, which is helpful for analyzing the drift of 'heading' and some other state variables.
'heading' is stable with `std = 0.13` while the 'azimuth' is relatively stable with `std = 2.34`, and 'track ground' is not valid.
The system seems using heading information from dual antenna for sensor fusion.

Question: if there is a slight drift or offset (0.2~0.4 degree), is this caused by accumulated wheel angle offset?
- Plot the drift segment with wheel angle and associated statistics including mean, mean abs, std.
