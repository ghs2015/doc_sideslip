## todo
- csv data to frame or key frame

## maybe
- C++ auto format
- C++ code checker

## notes
- csv -> c++ -> corresponding objects (frame or imu??)
- [x] write code to load csv data.
	- use a single csv file to store all the data, fetch whatever you want
- [x] write a test case for simu.csv loading.
- [x] quickly read test case: test cam pose factor.cpp
