1. Introduction

Vehicle sideslip angle (VSA) estimation has been a big challenge since the introduction of the very
first on-board active systems controlling vehicle stability, such as the electronic stability control (ESC,
also known as ESP) in the early 1990s [1].

Nowadays, vehicle control systems (VCS) such as rear wheel steering, active steering, direct yaw
moment control (DYC) through active differentials or torque vectoring, advanced traction controls, and
the above-mentioned ESC (in all its forms) are used in conjunction to extend the vehicle performance
and stability envelopes. They enhance road-holding capabilities, cornering performance, drivability,
and ultimately stability, especially assisting the driver during emergency manoeuvres and in poor
“grip” conditions [2–5]. All of these controls rely on vehicle state real-time assessments, and on VSA
monitoring in particular. A fast and accurate estimation of the VSA can be considered a key to active
safety, reducing the likelihood of dangerous events such as instability, loss of control, and roll-over,
hence decreasing the number of accidents directly and abating the social impact of mobility.

The VSA is strongly related with the dynamic behaviour of ground vehicles. In purely kinematic
terms, the VSA amplitude depends upon lateral acceleration, vehicle mass and mass distribution,

Safe Estimation of Vehicle Side-Slip 
for Autonomous Heavy Vehicle 

Background Side-slip is a fundamental motion state that is used to control the vehicle, i.e. for 
controlling the path and the lateral stability of the vehicle. The classical method is to estimate side-

slip by combining vehicle dynamics models with measurements of accelerometers on-board the 

vehicle. Due to parameter uncertainties in for example tires and accelerometer drift, it is in general 

difficult to estimate side-slip with high accuracy. For autonomous vehicles there is a need for side-

slip estimates with a high level of functional safety. This means than the side-slip estimator should 

estimate correctly to not generate any hazard threaten the vehicle.

Objective The objective is to design a filter to estimate side-slip used for autonomous heavy 
vehicles. The design should primarily focus on being safe, e.g. not producing outliers. Important is to 

estimate the variance of the estimate to address to the vehicle motion controller about the side-slip 

uncertainty. A tool for formal verification of the estimator should also be designed to understand 

the space of admissible parameters of sensors and vehicle to fulfill safety requirements. This tool 

should in turn be applied to formulate requirements of e.g. box constraints of tire parameters and 

mass distribution. 

Scope and Method The first part of the thesis is to perform a literature survey in side-slip 
estimation and then design at least one filter e.g. EKF, UKF, particle filter etc. An earlier master thesis 

have been carried out [1], However, the reliability and requirements were not included in the earlier 

thesis. The requirements of the side-slip will be given as input for the new master thesis. 

Experimental data including ground truth, will be given. Particular focus will be put on a tractor 

semi-trailer combination. Next part is to develop the formal verification tool and formulate 

requirements.  

The duration of the study will be 20 weeks (30 ETCs, MSc thesis). The work will be carried out at 

Volvo Group. The outcome has potential to be published in a scientific journal or conference 

(depending on quality and ambitions). Suitable background is vehicle dynamics, control theory, 

signal processing. Both Mechanical and Signal processing engineering are valuable. Start date is Jan 

2019.
